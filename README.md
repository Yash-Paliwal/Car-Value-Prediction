# Car-Value-Prediction
This is a Car Price Regression model that could inform whether the car he wanted to buy was good value in relation to the market in general. I've extended this data set to include lots of other makes, so it would be cool to extend the car value prediction model.
for this Model , I used RandomForestClassifier
